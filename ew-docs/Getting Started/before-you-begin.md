Before starting your Fireblocks EW implementation, itâ€™s important to distinguish between the SDKs involved:

- The **Fireblocks EW client SDKs** (also referred to as the **EW SDK** and the **EW Core SDK**).
- The **Fireblocks SDK**.

Each serves a different purpose:

- The **EW SDKs** consists of platform-specific SDKs used in your _client app implementation_
- The **Fireblocks SDK** can be used for administrative EW operations and is initialized with an API user's private key. It can be used with one of two roles: [EW Admin and EW Signer](https://ncw-developers.fireblocks.com/v5.0/docs/api-communication#api-roles).
