# Android

- 64-bit mobile device (usually devices with at least 6GB of RAM)
- Android API version 27 (Android 8.0.1)

## Distribution ABI filters

> ðŸš§ Pay attention
> 
> The SDK ABI Filter does not limit your app distribution to 64-bit. You must ensure that your app's `build.grade` file imposes this limitation. For additional information, refer to the [Android official guidelines](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis).

The SDK requires a minimum of 64-bit devices. The `build.grade` file includes the following ABI Filters:

```
ndk {
  abiFilters 'arm64-v8a', 'x86_64'
}
```
