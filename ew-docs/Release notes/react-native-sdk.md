# What's new in 1.0.0

In version 1.0.0, we release an additional SDK, compatible with React Native.

You may visit our package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fireblocks/react-native-ncw-sdk) .

All of the functionalities you already know such as [MPC Key Generation](doc:mpc-key-generation), [Backup and Recovery](doc:backup-recovery-1) and many more are now available too!

Please visit the [Setup](doc:setup-4) section in order to get started. You may use all of our Web code examples to refer on how to implement our React Native compatible SDK with your application.
