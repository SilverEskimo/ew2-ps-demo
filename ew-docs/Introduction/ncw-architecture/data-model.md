# Overview

Fireblocks end user wallets (EUWs) are hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets. With our REST API, customers can easily create new wallets for their end users and add multiple accounts under them. Each account can contain different assets, and all transactions are signed using the end-user key generated for a specific wallet.
